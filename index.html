                        The most important question of the day is both pivotal and mundane at the same time.
                        It's one we've <br>all asked someone else at some point in our lives (possibly incessantly).  It's also a question we've each had to answer<br> at least once. 
                        The answer, however, is never the same and it depends entirely on who you are, who's responsible<br> for providing the meal, and what resources are available.

                         It's likely that you'll have to ask a parent, "What's for dinner?"  Every day you ask, and you always have the answer <br>you want to hear already pictured in your mind. 
                         The only correct answer is that, "dinner tonight will be a giant pot <br>of cheesy macaroni and you can eat as much of it as you want!"  Anything different is a huge disappointment.

                    <h2>If you're the parent of a child under the age of ten:</h2>
                    <p>
                         You already know the answer he/she wants to hear and sometimes find joy in coming up with alternative offerings.<br> If the child has been especially thoughful and obedient 
                         lately, maybe a giant pot of macaroni is in order. On the<br> other hand, if the child has been especially snippy lately, stuffed green-peppers may just be for dinner.  This, <br>of course, could be followed by the added punch of ice cream sundaes 
                         for dessert to anyone who finishes their meal.

                    <h2>If you're an adult responsible for providing your own dinner:</h2>
                    <p>
                         As long as you have no one else to please, your options are usually pretty simple. Whatever decision you make <br>each evening is most likely preceded by these two questions: 
                    </p>
                         <ol>
                            1) "Do I really feel like cooking and then cleaning it all up afterward?" <br>
                            2) "Does my budget allow me to just order take out instead?"
                         </ol>
                    <p>     
                         If ordering out, your options are pretty simple; limited only by your personal preferences.  If you'll be going through <br>the motions of cooking, however, you'll probably find yourself staring into the abyss of your
                         refrigerator or pantry <br>hoping to come up with a winning combination of ingredients. In this scenario, however, you may discover that<br> although the shelves are full there is nothing edible in your kitchen and opt for take-out 
                         anyway.

                    <h2>If you're not quite an adult but still responsible for <br>providing your own dinner:</h2>
                    <p>
                        (i.e. College student living on a next-to-nothing budget), your options may still be pretty simple.
                         More than likely, <br>the only items in your pantry are Ramen noodles, spaghetti and pasta sauce, and a partial loaf of bread.  The only<br> items in your refrigerator are the remnants of
                         Friday nights pizza and a stick of butter.  In this scenario, the least <br>amount of clean-up afterward is best, and Ramen noodles will probably be for dinner.
